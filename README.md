### Note: This project is just getting started. Please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/KCzmjDaDdC) to get involved. To stay informed about updates please star this repo and sign up for [XetHub](https://xethub.com/user/sign_up) to get the newsletter.

## What is it?

pyxet is a Python library that provides a lightweight interface for the [XetHub](https://xethub.com/) platform.

## Preliminary Features (more to come, get involved!)

1. A filesystem interface:
    * [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io)
        * copy
        * list
        * etc.
    * [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html)
    * [pathlib.Path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)(WIP)

2. Integrations:
    - [x] [GitHub](https://github.com) [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
    - [x] [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
    - [x] [polars](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/)
    - [x] [pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/)
    - [ ] [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/)
    - [ ] [dask](https://dask.org/)
    - [ ] [ray](https://ray.io/)

## Documentation
For API documentation and full examples, please see [here](https://pyxet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting Started
Assuming you are on a supported OS (MacOS or Linux) and are using a supported version of Python (3.7+), set up your virtualenv with:

```sh
$ python -m venv .venv
...
$ . .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install pyxet with:

```sh
$ pip install pyxet
```

### Demo
To verify that pyxet is working, let's load a CSV file directly into a Pandas dataframe, leveraging pyxet's support for Python fsspec.

```python
# assumes you have already done pip install pandas
import pandas as pd
import pyxet

df = pd.read_csv('xet://xdssio/titanic/main/titanic.csv')
df
```

should return something like:

```
Out[3]:
     PassengerId  Survived  Pclass  ...     Fare Cabin  Embarked
0              1         0       3  ...   7.2500   NaN         S
1              2         1       1  ...  71.2833   C85         C

[891 rows x 12 columns]
```

### Next Steps - Working with private repos (How to set pyxet credentials)
To start working with private repositories, you need to set up credentials for pyxet. The steps to do this are as follows:

1. Sign up for [XetHub](https://xethub.com/user/sign_up)
2. Install [git-xet client](https://xethub.com/explore/install)
3. Create a [Personal Access Token](https://xethub.com/explore/install). Click on 'CREATE TOKEN' button.
4. Copy & Execute Login command, it should look like: `git xet login -u rajatarya -e rajat@xethub.com -p **********`
5. To make these credentials available to pyxet, set the -u param (rajatarya above) and the -p param as XET_USER_NAME and XET_USER_TOKEN environment variables. Also, for your python session, `pyxet.login()` will set the environment variables for you.

```sh
# Note: set this environment variable into your shell config (ex. .zshrc) so not lost.
export XET_USER_NAME=<YOUR XETHUB USERNAME>
export XET_USER_TOKEN=<YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN PASSWORD>
```

### ML Demo

A slightly more complete demo doing some basic ML is as simple as setting up your virtualenv with:

```sh
pip install scikit-learn ipython pandas
```
```python
import pyxet

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# make sure to set your XET_USER_NAME and XET_USER_TOKEN environment variables, or run:
# pyxet.login('username', 'token')

df = pd.read_csv("xet://xdssio/titanic.git/main/titanic.csv")  # read data from XetHub
target_names, features, target = ['die', 'survive'], ["Pclass", "SibSp", "Parch"], "Survived"

test_size, random_state = 0.2, 42
train, test = train_test_split(df, test_size=test_size, random_state=random_state)
model = RandomForestClassifier().fit(train[features], train[target])
predictions = model.predict(test[features])
print(classification_report(test[target], predictions, target_names=target_names))

# Any parameters we want to save
info = classification_report(test[target], predictions,
                             target_names=target_names,
                             output_dict=True)
info["test_size"] = test_size
info["random_state"] = random_state
info['features'] = features
info['target'] = target
```

## Contributing & Getting Help
This project is just getting started. We were so eager to get pyxet out that we have not gotten all the code over to this repository yet. We will bring the code here very soon. We fully intend to develop this package in public under the BSD license. 

In the coming days we will add a roadmap to make it easier to know when pyxet features are being implemented and how you can help.

For now, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/KCzmjDaDdC) to talk with us. We have ambitious plans and some very useful features under development / partially working (ex. write back to XetHub repos, easy commit messages, stream repositories locally, easily load the same file across Git branches, and more).
